## Who were Harry Partch and Lou Harrison?
Harry Partch and Lou Harrison were both prominent 20th-century American composers who built their own experimental musical instruments. Telling the stories of these artists in full involves many considerations -- Partch's influences from Japanese kabuki theater & life as a transient in Depression-era work camps, along with Harrison's pacifism, gay activism, and interest in Indonesian gamelan music. These aspects of Partch and Harrison's lives will be discussed, but for the purpose of maintaining a manageable scope and clear focus, this history will primarily focus on the instruments they built and how these instruments informed Partch and Harrison's musical philosophies and compositional aesthetics.
