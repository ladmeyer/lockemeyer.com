KnitPick#++ is a programming language that generates knitting patterns. It was my final project for CSCI 334: Programming Languages, and was co-developed with my friend Felix King (who was also taking the class). Read the [specification](https://github.com/ladmeyer/knitpick/blob/main/docs/specification.pdf) or watch the demo video below to learn more.
