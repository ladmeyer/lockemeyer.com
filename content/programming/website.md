You're lookin' at it right now! I got lockemeyer.com up and running in January 2024 to learn about web development and so that I would have a central place to host things I make. It's built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) with the [anemone](https://www.getzola.org/themes/anemone/) theme, and is inspired by my friend Satya's [personal site](https://satchlj.com/).
