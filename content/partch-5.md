## Legacies & Impact
- context: why are they not as well-known? United States support for the arts as another challenge
    - part of reason they were so individual being because they werenâ€™t raised	in an environment like Vienna
    - music not nearly as promoted by institutions
    - infrastructure for composers
    - marginality & originality
- discussion of the lasting impact these composers have had on American and international music
- challenges presented by their idiosyncratic approaches (need for their custom instruments/highly specific tunings) that have limited the spread of their ideas
- Musik Fabrik
