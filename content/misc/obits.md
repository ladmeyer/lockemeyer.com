Locke is not a common first name. Seeking community & dark insight, I compiled [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KCr6alud3gPgXq571Fq7uuXoOPU1gnqjEqPZzqZy_xg/edit?usp=sharing) and read it aloud on the radio in early 2023. Plain text = obituary, italicized text = comments left on the obituary's online page by friends or relatives. My favorite Locke is Locke Larkin.
