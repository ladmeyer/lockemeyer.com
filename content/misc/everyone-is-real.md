At the end of the spring semester of my sophomore year (roughly April - May 2023), I spent, over the course of a few weeks, four hour-long radio shows reading the names of every student at Williams College out loud on [91.9 WCFM](https://sites.williams.edu/wcfm/). This happened as part of my radio show, "Wait Wait, Don't Tell Me! The NPR News Quiz" -- no relation to the one hosted by Peter Sagal. I read the names in a random order so that nobody would be able to predict when theirs would be read, and when I read the name of someone who I knew, I said a few things about them. The highest number of concurrent listeners recorded was 25.
