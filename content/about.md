## Locke's Deal (In Full)
I was born in 2004 in Chicago, IL. In 2006, shortly before my younger sister was born, my family moved to [Villa Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Ridge,_Missouri), MO. We moved again to [St. Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis), MO (which I consider my hometown) in 2010. There, I attended [SLLIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Language_Immersion_School), a language immersion school where classes were taught in Spanish, through 5th grade. I can still understand written Spanish pretty well, but I've lost a lot of the vocabulary I had then, so speaking it is pretty tough. Around this time, I started programming in Scratch, making games and animations.

For middle school, I attended [McKinley CLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinley_Classical_Leadership_Academy). There, I started playing clarinet in the school band, and was soon taking lessons and playing in recitals. For high school, I went to [Metro Academic and Classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Academic_and_Classical_High_School), where I completed an International Baccalaureate diploma. I also continued playing clarinet (participating in various honor bands and festivals, and eventually a youth orchestra) and programming for fun.

Now, I'm a junior at [Williams College](https://www.williams.edu/) in Massachusetts. I'm doing a double major in music and computer science. On campus, I regularly perform in the [Berkshire Symphony](https://music.williams.edu/ensembles/berkshire-symphony/), various chamber music groups, and with [I/O New Music](https://music.williams.edu/ensembles/io/). I've also played in pit bands for musicals, pit orchestras for operas, and in basements -- think pits under houses -- for college students. I work in the scene shop in the ['62 Center](https://62center.williams.edu/), building sets and hanging lights. I've taught two classes to my peers that were ostensibly about food and drink: Aqueous Gastronomy and Extraterrestrial Gastronomy. In my spare time, I enjoy building instruments, cooking, reading books, watching movies, and writing, playing, and listening to music. For an in-depth look at my taste, click [here](/taste). 

My main goal in life is to have a modestly-sized garden where I can grow herbs and vegetables.

## This Website 
[lockemeyer.com](https://lockemeyer.com/) is my personal website. It is built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) with the [anemone](https://www.getzola.org/themes/anemone/) theme. Its chief purpose is to host things I've made that I think merit sharing with other people, but it also serves as a general repository for stuff I find funny or interesting. It is designed to contain hidden passages and secret treasures.  Many thanks to my friend [Satya Benson](https://satchlj.com/), whose open-source personal website helped me out a lot in the process of coding it up.
