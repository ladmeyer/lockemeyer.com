I'm a junior at Williams College in Massachusetts studying music and computer science.

Right now, I'm on campus for the Winter Study term. Current projects are teaching ASTR / PHIL 501: Extraterrestrial Gastronomy 
and building this website. I'm also doing an independent study, "Inventions and Sinfonias", where I'm learning about and 
attempting to write new pieces in the style of J. S. Bach's contrapuntal music.
