I'm a junior at Williams College in Massachusetts studying music and computer science.

Right now, I'm in Vienna studying abroad. I'm living in an apartment in the 5th district with six other people, who I've become quite close with. I'm working on my German, seeing lots of concerts from standing room at the Musikverein, visiting museums, and making music.
