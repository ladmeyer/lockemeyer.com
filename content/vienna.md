**1/22** -- arrived in Vienna, moved into shared apartment on Margaretenstrasse, met roommates, went to Zw√∂lf Apostelkeller for dinner (very cool setting, OK food), then slept for a longgg time.

**1/23** -- bought groceries at Hofer (Austrian version of Aldi), went to first orientation session, walked around 1st district -- most touristy area, but very cool; kind of like Times Square but with lots of cobbled streets and alleyways -- saw Wiener Staatsoper, and went inside St. Stephen's Cathedral (INCREDIBLE -- WILL BE BACK)
