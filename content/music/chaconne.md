I wrote this during the summer of 2023. A new practice organ had recently been installed in Bernhard Music Center, and I was having a lot of fun playing around with its stops and pedals. I was also on a Brahms 4 kick, so the passacaglia in the final movement of that symphony was on my mind, which is where the piece's form comes from. I called mine a chaconne instead of a passacaglia, since it involves a repeating bassline instead of an ostinato that can appear in any voice (this distinction is [somewhat controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaconne#Chaconne_and_passacaglia)). It was premiered in Thompson Memorial Chapel on November 15th, 2023. The performers are myself (clarinet) and my friend Nate Welsh (organ).
