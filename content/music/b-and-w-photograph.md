This was the first thing I ever wrote that was performed in public, so it holds a special place in my heart. It was premiered as part of I/O Fest 2023 at the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, MA. The performers are Sara Stebbins (violin), Samantha Strickland (horn), and Francesca Hellerman (electric piano). The title of the piece is derived from a photograph taken by my good friend [William Mennerick](https://mennerick.myportfolio.com/) at Kaaterskill Falls in Upstate New York in November 2022.
