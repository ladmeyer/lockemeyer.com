This is the soundtrack I made to accompany Aqueous Gastronomy, the course I taught with my good friend Felix King. I would describe the genre as experimental post-Garageband electronica, but the album is diverse in style; there's a little something for everyone. 

Some song title explanations:
- **Brownrigg's Jig** -- William Brownrigg was a British doctor and scientist who was the first person to aerate water with carbon dioxide.
- **We Have A Package That Arrived For You That Is Leaking And Has An Odor** -- This was a sentence in an email we got from the campus mailroom.
