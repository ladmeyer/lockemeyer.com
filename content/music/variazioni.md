After finishing MUS 104a, the second music theory class I took at Williams, I wrote this. It was one of my first pieces. The theme is the keyboard solo from In My Life by The Beatles. There's a lot I would do differently if I wrote this now; I include it here mainly because it's somehow attracted a modest following on MuseScore, and the below comment makes me smile.
