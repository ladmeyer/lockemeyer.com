## Mature/Late Styles
- Final articulations/expressions of Partch and Harrison’s musical philosophies
- Partch: association with director Madeline Tourtelot, return to California, meeting Danlee Mitchell, further evolving “corporeal” style – i.e. dramaturgically intense, musically eclectic, instruments & performers in full view of audience, influences from various non-Western musical traditions. Delusion of the Fury (1965)
- Harrison: “American gamelan”, works for traditional gamelan ensemble, combinations of eastern/western instruments, & return to Western forms like the symphony & concerto utilizing cross-cultural applications of compositional techniques (e.g. gamelan-esque textures in a piano concerto). Suite for Violin with American Gamelan (1973)
