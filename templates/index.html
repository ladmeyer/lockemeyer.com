  <h1>Lazy Boy</h1>
</header>

<p>
The living room was the corner of the house. <br>
After being exposed to magazine air for many years, <br>
the easy chair hardened: <br>
leather transmuted into granite. <br><br>

In front of the stone chair is a TV table <br>
piled with Yankee candles <br>
stacked one on top of the other. <br>
They're in the bleachers watching hockey, <br>
and the numbers and geometry here <br>
imply an expected donation <br>
to the Church of Meadow Showers or Wedding Day. <br>
Wicks tall and still above the radiator - <br>
there is far too much wax surrounding them <br>
for these votives to be holy. <br><br>

Now granite is transmuted into stainless steel, <br>
and parchment paper from the kitchen <br>
is rolled in across the floor <br>
to cover the newly medical piece of furniture. <br>
A hand-knit IV bag drips saline solution <br>
onto a pile of smooth newspapers. <br><br>

Ducks swim across the four vertical ponds that define the room, <br>
moving in concentric circles around cattails sprouting from <br>
the points of antlers floating perpendicular to the water. <br>
Finally the steel gives way to beautiful pine, <br>
endlessly sanded and varnished. <br>
All of a sudden, a hole opens up in the floor and swallows the man. <br><br>

The TV is still on. <br>
"Here's the kicker: " <br>
(says the weatherman) <br>
"When you finally recline after everything, <br>
when you are supine for the last time, <br>
after the last parallel parking job, <br>
the last stubbed toe, <br>
the last love affair, <br>
someone else lays your <br>
weary, empty head onto the pillow. <br>
You don't even get to feel it happen. <br>
It's going to be sunny tomorrow."
