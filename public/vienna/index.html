<h1>Vienna</h1>



<p><strong>1/22</strong> -- Arrived in Vienna, moved into shared apartment on Margaretenstrasse, met roommates, went to Zwölf Apostelkeller for dinner (very cool setting, OK food), then slept for a longgg time.</p>
<p><strong>1/23</strong> -- Bought groceries at Hofer (Austrian version of Aldi), went to first orientation session, walked around 1st district -- most touristy area, but very cool; kind of like Times Square but with lots of cobbled streets and alleyways -- saw Wiener Staatsoper, and went inside St. Stephen's Cathedral (INCREDIBLE -- WILL BE BACK)</p>
<p><strong>1/24</strong> -- Another info session in the morning, then a walking tour of the 1st district led by a funny older guy who's lived in Vienna his entire life. Pointed out many many sights, including Josefsplatz (a public square at the Hofburg Palace), Stallburg (the former imperial stables), and the balcony from which Hitler delivered the Anschluss speech declaring the annexation of Austria by the Third Reich. Paid too much for coffee at a little cafe and then got a hamburger from McDonalds. Then a guided tour of the Leopold Museum -- lots of great stuff by Klimt and Schiele, and a self-portrait by Schoenberg. Will also be back here.</p>
<p><strong>1/25</strong> -- Started the day with the first class of my two-week German intensive, taught by Prof. Summesberger, a very sweet older Austrian woman. Cool animal-print scarf. She talked about learning Russian as a child, since she grew up in a district in Vienna that the USSR was in control of post-WWII. Then another information session before returning home for lunch. In the afternoon, I talked with Heidi, a coordinator for IES who matches students with schools in Vienna so they can work as teaching assistants; I'm hoping to teach English and maybe also music. After finishing a phone interview with a company in the US, I had some chicken soup that EB made for dinner and chatted with roommates until it was time to slept.</p>
