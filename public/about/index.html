<h2 id="locke-s-deal-in-full">Locke's Deal (In Full)</h2>
<p>I was born in 2004 in Chicago, IL. In 2006, shortly before my younger sister was born, my family moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Ridge,_Missouri">Villa Ridge</a>, MO. We moved again to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis">St. Louis</a>, MO (which I consider my hometown) in 2010. There, I attended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Language_Immersion_School">SLLIS</a>, a language immersion school where classes were taught in Spanish, through 5th grade. I can still understand written Spanish pretty well, but I've lost a lot of the vocabulary I had then, so speaking it is pretty tough. Around this time, I started programming in Scratch, making games and animations.</p>
<p>For middle school, I attended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinley_Classical_Leadership_Academy">McKinley CLA</a>. There, I started playing clarinet in the school band, and was soon taking lessons and playing in recitals. For high school, I went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Academic_and_Classical_High_School">Metro Academic and Classical</a>, where I completed an International Baccalaureate diploma. I also continued playing clarinet (participating in various honor bands and festivals, and eventually a youth orchestra) and programming for fun.</p>
<p>Now, I'm a junior at <a href="https://www.williams.edu/">Williams College</a> in Massachusetts. I'm doing a double major in music and computer science. On campus, I regularly perform in the <a href="https://music.williams.edu/ensembles/berkshire-symphony/">Berkshire Symphony</a>, various chamber music groups, and with <a href="https://music.williams.edu/ensembles/io/">I/O New Music</a>. I've also played in pit bands for musicals, pit orchestras for operas, and in basements -- think pits under houses -- for college students. I work in the scene shop in the <a href="https://62center.williams.edu/">'62 Center</a>, building sets and hanging lights. I've taught two classes to my peers that were ostensibly about food and drink: Aqueous Gastronomy and Extraterrestrial Gastronomy. In my spare time, I enjoy building instruments, cooking, reading books, watching movies, and writing, playing, and listening to music. For an in-depth look at my taste, click <a href="/taste">here</a>. </p>
<p>My main goal in life is to have a modestly-sized garden where I can grow herbs and vegetables.</p>
<h2 id="this-website">This Website</h2>
<p><a href="https://lockemeyer.com/">lockemeyer.com</a> is my personal website. It is built using <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> with the <a href="https://www.getzola.org/themes/anemone/">anemone</a> theme. Its chief purpose is to host things I've made that I think merit sharing with other people, but it also serves as a general repository for stuff I find funny or interesting. It is designed to contain hidden passages and secret treasures.  Many thanks to my friend <a href="https://satchlj.com/">Satya Benson</a>, whose open-source personal website helped me out a lot in the process of coding it up.</p>
